# RIS-Lab-2
Here are some models I created for respective linear control systems in MATLAB/Simulink.

The topics for the respective labs are as follows:

Lab 1 - RC Circuit using Subsystem Blocks and Functions.
Lab 2 - Brushed DC Motor Model
Lab 3 - A brushed Motor Model
Lab 4 - The PID controller for Speed Regulation
Lab 5 - Discretization of the Controller
